# up221-Shweta
### Hello fellow GIS aficionados,
##### My name is Shweta Sundar, a second year MURP with a focus on Design and Development. With a background in architecture, I have always been facinated with maps and plans to study spatial proxomities, movement patterns, and macro-level information in cities which translates into our physical experience of a place. Having grown up in different parts of India, and then arriving in LA last year, I am curious how different spatal regulatory controls such as zoning, land-use and building-envelope limitations create different urban environments. I run, bike, paint and caricate!
##### This is me.

### Project ideas
##### My Data Science project is to conduct a spatial analysis of [high opportunity areas](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/2022-tcac-opportunity-map) in Los Angeles to analyze their feasiblity and viability to support more housing production and affordable housing. I will be analyzing Community Plan Areas on a set of spatial, political, economic, and environmental variables to support my recommendations. 

### My objectives for this class
 1. Use data to tell stories and create maps that can be understood by my mom and Rachele understands.
 2. Find innovative data sources to create maps, since there is limited and often faulty data available in India.
 3. Get over my fear of Python.
