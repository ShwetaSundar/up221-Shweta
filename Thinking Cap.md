## [Spatializing Political Conflicts in India](https://acleddata.com/2016/03/03/asian-overview-2015/)
### Summary
The article attempts to spatialize various types of political conflicts in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in 2015. Based on the type of political conflict and the actors involved, it attempts to draw causal relationships between political, religions, and cultural events within that geography and timeframe. The geographical distribution of conflicts also allows the viewer to understand political orientations of governments and citizens in different states across the country, and topics of political contention. The article also draws comparisons within India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and other South East Asian countries to some detail on political and religious grounds.

How do you think the graphical outputs (maps/charts) were created for the article? Where did the data come from, and how do you think the outputs were created? Does it work? Why or why not?

### Analysis
Graphical Outputs such as these maps and graphs allow us to comprehend the magnitude of these conflicts on a national level. It also allows the viewer to understand the nature of the conflicts in certain locations. For eg: government forces were more active on the India-Pakistan border and many high-altitude passes in the North-West Himalayas which were strategically held by rebel groups. Additionally, within a state, adjacencies with different states influence the type of conflict, news of which usually gets bundled into a homogenous category. 
The data used is the ACLED dataset, which is an event-based dataset containing disaggregated incident information on political violence, demonstrations, and select related non-violent developments around the world.  
ArchGIS or QGIS is used to for spatial analysis, and Tableau is used to create the visualizations (maps and graphs).
I would have liked the map to be interactive, with additional information regarding the political and geographic characteristics that is used to make spatial connections in the report.
